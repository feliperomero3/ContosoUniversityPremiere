# Contoso University

This web app is loosely based on Contoso University built in [Razor Pages with Entity Framework Core in ASP.NET Core - Tutorial 1 of 8](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-rp/intro?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio) By Tom Dykstra and Rick Anderson.

## Introduction

The Contoso University sample web app demonstrates how to create an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages app using Entity Framework (EF) Core.

The sample app is a web site for a fictional Contoso University. It includes functionality such as student admission, course creation, and instructor assignments.

Here are a few of the screens created in the tutorial.

![student-edit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-rp/intro/_static/student-edit.png)

The UI style of this site is close to what's generated by the built-in templates. The tutorial focus is on EF Core with Razor Pages, not the UI.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2019
- .NET Core 2.2
- SQL Server Data Tools

If you installed Visual Studio 2019 with Web development workload you'll have everything you need to build this application.
